# House_Price_Predictor-Linear-Regression-
🏠 House Price Prediction – Supervised ML

This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict residential house prices using historical property data. The objective is to automate the pricing process for a real estate company by leveraging supervised machine learning techniques.

The dataset includes property features such as lot size, zoning classification, building type, construction year, basement area, condition rating, and more. The workflow involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training a regression model.

Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics including MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of regression modeling, feature engineering, and performance evaluation using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
